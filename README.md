# A24_Films
## **Description**
I am absolutely obsessed with the booming growth of A24 Production Company. The company has taken the movie world by storm and over the past decade has become one of the leading film and show production companies, not only in Hollywood, but across the world. During this series of projects, I will take data that I have scraped from different sites and use that to analyze A24's trends through April 2024, and find predicted projections to where it will continue to grow. What new heights will this independent studio reach?

## **Programming Languages/Software**
- Python: 
  - Requests, BeautifulSoup - Scraping web data and exporting .CSV files
  - Pandas - Aggregating and analyzing the data
